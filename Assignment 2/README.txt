How to run the Algorithms: 
Requirments:
  - Please ensure you have Java installed on your system.
  - Please ensure that the `Knapsack instances` folder is present in the same directory as the `Ant Colony Optimization` and  `Genetic Algorithm` folders, such that they are 'siblings'

Ant Colony Optimization:
    - Step inside the `Ant Colony Optimization` folder. 
    - Run the following commands on a terminal: 
      - Compile: javac *.java
      - Run the executable: java Main
      - Clean/remove the executables: rm *.class (for unix system) or del *.class (for a windows terminal)

Genetic Algorithm:
    - Step inside the `Genetic Algorithm` folder. 
    - Run the following commands on a terminal: 
      - Compile: javac *.java
      - Run the executable: java Main
      - Clean/remove the executables: rm *.class (for unix system) or del *.class (for a windows terminal)
